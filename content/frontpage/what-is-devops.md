DevOps, the clipped compound of "development" and "operations", is a term that
practitioners of devops use to describe the implementation of a set of principles
that promote an alternative to traditional workplace ideology and culture.

Themes such as empathy, cooperation and shared responsibility provide a foundation for how
groups of people can improve the environment in which they live and work.
