We are a group of existing and aspiring IT professionals living and working in
the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul MN. Every month we get together to
hear from speakers, share our own DevOps journeys and discuss the ways in which
we use the principles of DevOps to improve our personal and professional lives.

We encourage any and all who are interested in sharing their experiences or learning
more about DevOps to join us in our <a class="page-scroll" href="#participate">Slack
channel or at our next monthly meetup</a>.
