The DevOps MSP community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.
Individuals violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
community spaces at the sole discretion of the community organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

  * Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
  * Sexual images in public spaces
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
  * Harassing photography or recording
  * Sustained disruption of talks or other events
  * Inappropriate physical contact
  * Unwelcome sexual attention
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

### Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, community organizers retain the
right to take any actions to keep community spaces a welcoming environment for
all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from community
spaces.

Community organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
clear impact of, disrupting community events or making the environment hostile
for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related
social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

### Reporting
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our community for everyone. We want you to be happy in our community. People like
you make our community a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous Report

#### Personal Report
You can make a personal report by:

  * Messaging [@devopsmsp](http://twitter.com/devopsmsp) on Twitter.
  * The #report channel in the [DevOps MSP slack](http://devopsmsp.slack.com).

When taking a personal report, our organizers will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is
managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This
can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can
bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't
tell anyone who you are.

Our organizers will be happy to help you contact security, local law enforcement,
local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for
the duration of the community event. We value your attendance.
